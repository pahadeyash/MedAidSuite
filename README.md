Alexa has two skills.
Lifeline: Contact your emergency contact when you are unable to do so. In situations where you have collapsed and can't get up, your phone is out of reach, or your arms are chopped off, you can still reach your emergency contact.
"Alexa, open lifeline" + "Yes"/"Emergency"/"Call For Help"

Medical Help: Walk you through emergency first aid procedure, and save the critical health information for your first responders to use. 
"Alexa, open Medical Help" + "Yes/No"
"Alexa, open Medical Help" + "Recall"
